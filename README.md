# PoStaL

PoStaL is a machine learning-based prediction tool for **P**athogenicity **o**f **Sta**rt-**L**ost variants.
This page provides;
1. Full list of pathogenicity scores of any possible start-lost variants in canonical transcripts (defined by SnpEff)
2. Features used for model construction
3. R objects of the constructed models
4. Source code to reproduce the figures in our publication
5. Full list of the length of amino acid residues by a stop-lost variant
