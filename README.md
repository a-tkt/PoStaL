# PoStaL

PoStaL is a machine learning-based prediction tool for **P**athogenicity **o**f **Sta**rt-**L**ost variants.
This page provides;
1. Full list of pathogenicity scores of any possible start-lost variants in canonical transcripts defined by SnpEff (postal_all.txt)
2. Features used for model construction (postal_features.txt)
3. R objects of the constructed model (postal_model.obj)
4. R source code to reproduce the figures in our publication (postal_fig.txt)
5. Full list of the length of amino acid residues extended by a stop-lost variant (stopAA.txt)
